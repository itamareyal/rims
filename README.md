RIMS - Ratchet based Ion Movement Simulator.
This simulator creates an environment of a selected ion in water, the user specifies a potential profile to be activated on the environment. That potential profile with a time based function is a ratchet, it's activation is capable of creating an ion current. This simulator will calculate the change in location of the ions and the current generated. Different ions have different diffusion, thus may react in different ways to the same ratchet. Causing ion separation in water by implementing a specific kind of ratchet.

Console based application written in python.
