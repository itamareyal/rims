I decided to use ratchet profiles from a csv, make sure it's set as follows:

csv file name: DATA_CSV_FILE = 'test_profiles.csv'

content:

    x, t0, t1... tn
    v00, v01, v02... v0n
    v10, v11, v12... v1n
    ...
    vk0, vk1, vk2... vkn

    x   = length of the potential profile [um]
    ti  = absolute time when vi switches to vi+1 [SEC]
    tn  = time period of the whole ratchet marked T
    k+1 = number of different potential profile
    vi  = vector describing the shape of potential profile i [volt]

    NOTE: all potential profiles must be of the same length and same number of points
